### During Developement of this website.

For the Gradient Color i use `webgradients.com`, it holds a lot of gradient colour collections.
Data is written in JSON format, already included in this project.

### Data Collection

Use existing website and also the use of `AI` and for the image, i use `Unsplash`.

### Future Improvement

A detailed overview about each location, like `accomodation`, `overall expanse`, `hotel recommendation` and `best way to travel`.
